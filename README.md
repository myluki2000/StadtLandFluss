# Setup

## Server

The server requires 3 extra files in its executable directory (the same directory the SlfServer.exe file lies in):

* stadt.txt
* land.txt
* fluss.txt

These files contain the valid solutions for the three categories, separated by newlines.

Pre-made files containing valid answers for the continent of Europe (extracted from OpenStreetMap data) can be
downloaded at http://api.lutr.me/stadtlandfluss.zip
